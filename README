# Chess!

A full Chess application that allows 2 players to play chess against each other


## Features

 - 2 players can play against each other
 - All possible moves for each piece is shown when the piece is clicked
 - If your side is in check, only moves that stop the check are shown
 - When there are no such moves from #3, checkmate is declared
 - When there are no possible moves but the king is not in check, stalemate is declared
 - Supports special moves like castle, en passant, and promotion (only promotion to Queen is supported. Unable to promote pawn to rook, knight, or bishop. Support for different promotions coming soon)

## Color Guide

When you click on a piece, you will see several different colors depending on what kind of move the piece can make

Blue = Move
Red = Kill
Green = Castle
Purple = Promotion
